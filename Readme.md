This project is a complex backend project that is built with nodejs, expressjs, mongodb, mongoose, jwt, bcrypt, and many more. It aims to build a platform similar to YouTube, with features like user authentication, video uploading, liking, disliking, commenting, replying, subscribing, and unsubscribing.

In terms of security and best practices, it incorporates JWT for secure user authentication, bcrypt for password protection, and employs access and refresh tokens for added security measures.
